    <p class="paragraphs">Diana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House, Sandringham, Norfolk. 
        She was the fourth of five children of John Spencer, Viscount Althorp (1924–1992), and 
        Frances Spencer, Viscountess Althorp (née Roche; 1936–2004).
        The Spencer family had been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations; 
        Diana's grandmothers, Cynthia Spencer, Countess Spencer and Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, had served 
        as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry 
        on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her 
        mother and after Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales. 
        Within the family, she was also known informally as "Duch", a reference to her duchess-like attitude in 
        childhood</p>
    <p class="paragraphs">Diana was initially home-schooled under the supervision of her governess, Gertrude Allen. 
        She began her formal education at Silfield Private School in Gayton, Norfolk, and moved to 
        Riddlesworth Hall School, an all-girls boarding school near Thetford, when she was nine.
        She joined her sisters at West Heath Girls' School in Sevenoaks, Kent, in 1973.
        She did not shine academically, failing her O-levels twice. Her outstanding community spirit was 
        recognised with an award from West Heath.She left West Heath when she was sixteen.Her brother Charles 
        recalls her as being quite shy up until that time. She showed a talent for music as an accomplished pianist.
        She also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and tap dance</p>
